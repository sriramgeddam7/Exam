--------------------------------------------

a) Write a PL/SQL block for Addition of Two Numbers.
Here's a PL/SQL block for adding two numbers:
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;

DECLARE
    num1 NUMBER := 10;
    num2 NUMBER := 20;
    sum NUMBER;
BEGIN
    sum := num1 + num2;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The sum of ' || num1 || ' and ' || num2 || ' is: ' || sum);
END;
/

--------------------------------------------

B) b) Write a PL/SQL block for IF, IF and else condition.
Here's a PL/SQL block demonstrating IF and IF-ELSE conditions:

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;

DECLARE
    num1 NUMBER := 10;
    num2 NUMBER := 20;
BEGIN
    -- IF condition
    IF num1 > num2 THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(num1 || ' is greater than ' || num2);
    END IF;

    -- IF-ELSE condition
    IF num1 < num2 THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(num1 || ' is less than ' || num2);
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(num1 || ' is not less than ' || num2);
    END IF;
END;
